Process
	1. Copy the ‘master’ branch code from git server to your local machine using git clone command
	2. Create the branch out of master using git checkout command
	3. Make the changes you want add(git add) with message about changes(git commit -m) and update(git push) your changes into your branch
	4. Review your branch changes comparing with parent branch code with your lead or peers - Merger request/Pull request - through browser
	5. Let them merge your branch into master - through browser
	6. Now master is having your changes for others to take it(git pull)

Generate your local machine ssh keys
#ssh-keygen
	- copy the content of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to your git profile on the server
	#cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

#git clone <SSH url or HTTPS url>
	- gets a copy from git to server to your local machine/client using ‘clone’ command

#git status
	- to show you on which branch that you’re in
	- to show you what are all the files that you’ve modified

#git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
	- to create a new branch if it doesn’t exists

#git checkout <branch_name>
	- to switch to branch that you want

#git add <files/directories>
	- to mention about the files or directories that you have modified/created to commit

#git commit -m “<description about the change>”

#git push
	- push your local changes in to your branch in the server
	#git push --set-upstream origin ui_automation ===> in case this branch ui_automation isn’t available yet on the server
